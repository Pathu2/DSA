1. When to use Binary Search?
We will use binary search when we have to optimize the things like we have to 
find the maximum or minium, in this case we can use the binary search.

2. What approch we have to use while we have to the binary search?
We have to determine what is low and what is high and can be the default ans.
We should have an idea what should be the range of my ans, like in case of rotated array
it can be from 0 to length -1 as we have to print the index of the array. While, in case of
painter_partition lo should be maximum of the timing for each partition and maximum when 
we have only 1 painter. 
After this is done we have to implement the check function, which will return 0 or 1
depending on the mid element. 

#Which means range and check function.
